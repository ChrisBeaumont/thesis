Density or PPP structure/feature & A contiguous volume in real, PPP space. Defined by a 3D density contour.\\
Intensity or PPV structure/feature & A contiguous region in PPV space. Defined by intensity contours in a spectral line observation. \\
Density field & The density at each PPP location in a simulation \\
Velocity field & The (line-of-sight) velocity at each PPP location in a simulation \\
Intensity field & The intensity of a spectral line at each PPV location in a simulation \\
Confusion & General term for the imperfect correspondence between PPP structures and PPV structures. \\
